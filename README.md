# ModuleChallenge3

This is the third challenge in the DU Bootcamp. Being an odd number challenge, a portion of the code was provided. The majority of my work consisted of writing the js script. I have included in depth comments so that anyone might understand what each portion means. The application is a password generator. The user will be presented with a series of prompts and given a password catered to their preference. The following screenshot shows a password generated given an inputted length of 128 characters and all of the character types allowed.
